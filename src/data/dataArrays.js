      'Add the rice flour, tapioca starch (or cornstarch), salt and water to a mixing bowl. Mix and dissolve everything together well. Add 1 teaspoon of oil, and strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into another bowl. Cover the liquid and let rest for 30 minutes. \n\n While the mixture is resting, fill your wok (make sure that your flat-bottomed pan fits comfortably inside first!) with water. If you don’t have a wok, use a large, deep cooking vessel with a wide opening and a lid. Bring the water to a boil. (You might need to add more water throughout the cooking process. The goal is to have the pan float on top of the boiling water.) \n\n Brush a light coating of oil on the bottom of the flat-bottom pan, put the pan on top of the boiling water, and add a 1/4 cup of the rice liquid to the pan. Tilt it a little so the rice liquid covers the bottom of the pan.\n \n Now, cover with the pot/wok lid and cook on high heat for 5 minutes. If the flat bottom pan you use has a thicker bottom, e.g., Pyrex, increase the cooking time to 7 or 8 minutes. While it’s cooking, brush the second pan lightly with oil. \n\n After 5 minutes, remove the lid, take out the 1st pan, and set aside. Put the 2nd pan on top of the water in the wok, add a ¼ cup of the rice mixture. Tilt it a little so the rice liquid evenly covers the bottom, cover, and let cook. \n\nWhile it’s cooking, attend to the first pan. We’re going to lift the noodle sheet out and place it onto a cutting board. Brush the cutting board with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. Then, use a rubber spatula to loosen all sides of the sheet of noodle, and slowly lift it up and off the pan. Lay it flat on your cutting board. \n\nBy now, your second pan is probably ready. Remember to brush the first layer with a thin layer of oil before layering the second sheet on top to prevent sticking. \n\nNow brush the bottom of the 1st pan with some oil and get ready to make your 3rd batch. Repeat the above steps until all of the rice noodle batter is gone. Once all of the noodle sheets are made, I cut the noodle sheets into 1/3-inch wide pieces, but feel free to cut them in whatever sizes and shapes you like. I then toss the noodles, loosening each layer to separate them. Now the rice noodles are ready to be used! \n\nYou can store these noodles in the refrigerator for a day or two. They might harden slightly, but they should bounce back nicely once heated. Enjoy your homemade noodles! \n\n'

Drain and keep aside.\n\nTake ¼ cup thick poha in a bowl.\n\nBefore grinding, drain the urad dal, but don’t throw away the water. Reserve the soaked water.\n\nIn a wet grinder jar, add the urad dal. initially add ¼ cup of the reserved water.\n\nAnd grind the urad dal for some seconds. Then add ¼ cup water and continue to grind. The batter should be light and fluffy when completely ground.\n\nPour the urad dal batter in a deep pan or bowl.\n\nDrain the rice & poha and add them in the wet grinder jar. I usually grind in two parts. Depending on the capacity of your mixer-grinder you can grind in two to three parts. If the mixie gets heated up while grinding, then stop and let it cool. Then continue with the grinding.\n\nUse the urad dal strained water or regular water to grind the rice and poha too. add water in parts and grind. The rice can have a fine rava like consistency in the batter. A smooth batter is also fine. I usually add a total of ¾ cup of water while grinding rice. The rice batter should not be too thick or thin.\n\nNow pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.\n\nAdd 1 teaspoon rock salt. Mix very well with a spoon or spatula. If you live in a cool or cold region, then do not add salt. Add salt later once the fermentation is done. If you live in a hot or warm climate, then add salt as it does not allow the batter to get over fermented in the time duration of 6 to 8 hours.\n\nCover the bowl or container with a lid and keep the batter in a warm place. It should be left undisturbed for 8 to 9 hours. Don’t use an air-tight lid. In colder climate, keep the batter for a longer time – from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nThe batter the next morning. It will ferment and increase in volume.\n\nGrease the idli mould with oil. Gently and lightly swirl the batter. Don’t overdo. Now with a spoon pour portions of the batter in the greased idli moulds.\n\nTake your idli steamer or pressure cooker or electric cooker. Add some 2 to 2.5 cups water and heat the water. keep the idli mould in the steamer or pressure cooker. Steam for 12 to 15 minutes. Timing will vary depending on the kind of equipment you have used. If using a pressure cooker, then cover the pressure cooker with its lid. Remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid. Steam the idlis for approx 12 to 15 minutes.\n\nCheck for doneness by inserting a toothpick. If it does not come out clean, then keep again for a few more minutes. When done remove the idli mould from the cooker. Don’t overcook as then they become dry. Dip a spoon or butter knife in water and slid them through the idlis. Remove and place the idlis in a warm container like a casserole.\n\nServe Idli hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney.'

But if you are uncooked noodles at home, heat a large pot of salted water over low-medium flame and bring to a boil. Then add the noodles and cook in boiling water for about 10 minutes. When they are done, switch off the burner, drain the noodles well and rinse under cold water.\n\nDrain the noodles once again and transfer to a large bowl. Now add some oil and toss well, so that the noodles do not stick together. Boil the chicken pieces in some water for 10 minutes on low flame. Drain and keep aside.\n\nHeat oil in a deep frying pan over high flame, and saute the onions and garlic for a minute or until onions turn golden brown and translucent. Then add the chicken pieces in the sauteed onions and mix them well.\n\nSaute them for a minute and add the red chilli sauce and 3/4 tablespoon of light soy sauce. Then, add the remaining light soy sauce, cooked egg noodles and sweet soy sauce. Mix them well and cook the noodles for a minute or two. If you do not have these two varieties of soya sauces, you can replace them with the easily available dark soya sauce.\n\nPut another frying pan on low flame, heat a little oil in it, and add Tofu (you can substitute it with paneer, if tofu is not available) cubes into it and fry until they turn golden brown. Then add lettuce, capsicum, carrots and bean sprouts to the pan. Toss them gently with Tofu and cook for a minute.\n\nWhen your veggies are done, remove the frying pan from flame and pour all the vegetables over the cooked noodles and toss them gently once again. Chicken Fried Noodles are ready, serve it hot.'

    description: 'Dissolve the sugar in the warm milk; then add the yeast. Make sure that the milk is not too hot, lest it kill the yeast instead of promoting its growth. Place a plate or some kind of cover on top of the bowl with the milk, sugar and yeast. Set aside for about five minutes. When you check on it, the yeast should have bubbled up, looking light brown and spongy.\n\nMeanwhile, mix the sifted bread flour with the cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Pour in the yeast mixture; then add the whole egg and egg yolk. Mix on medium speed until it is fully combined. The dough will be yellow and stiff, yielding only slightly to a poke.\n\nCover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm place for about thirty minutes.\n\nBeat in the butter piece by piece; you do not have to wait for the prior piece to be fully incorporated before adding the next. When the dough has incorporated about half of the butter, the mixture will be like a very thick, somewhat broken-up paste. If you keep engaging the mixer on medium-high speed, the dough will eventually become a cohesive whole, looking smoother and more feeling more elastic. Scrape the sides of the bowl if needed.\n\nKneading very gently, incorporate the sugar crystals just enough to get them evenly distributed. Work quickly so as not to soften the buttery dough too much.\n\nDivide the dough into a dozen equal pieces, gently forming them into balls.\n\nPlace the balls of dough on a cutting board in a warmish place for fifteen minutes or so. During the last two minutes of this resting time, preheat your waffle iron until it is very warm, but not hot.\n\nSpray the griddles with cooking oil. Place each ball of dough in a whole square or section of the waffle iron. Like regular waffle batter, the dough will start to puff up. Cook the waffles until the surface is golden to dark brown. Be sure that the waffle iron you are using is appropriately deep, or else the interior of the waffle will not be cooked through. If you are using a vintage stovetop waffle iron, flip the iron every thirty to forty seconds, lifting the iron to check the rate of browning. The browning should be gradual to allow the interior to fully develop.\n\nSet the waffles on a cooling rack as they come out of the iron to promote a crispy exterior. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of powdered sugar.\n\nAny leftover waffles, if they are not dark brown, can be carefully re-cooked in a toaster for approximately thirty to sixty seconds. Leftover waffles may also be kept in an airtight container between sheets of parchment paper, for up to three days.'
